# COM-205-Project
CraigReino.com Redesign

This is for my Fall 2018 COM 205 semester project

Proposal contains the project details.

Mockups (Six of them) contain the individual layout specifications of the six pages that will be built. It is a standard template design for the pages.
There is potential, room to grow - time permitting, to add a second tier of pages that contain project collateral. (Not part of what is promised for the project by end of semester)

Pages have conceptual text and place holding images as well as framework for the visual concept of the flow of the page.
Additional text will be added for the final stage.
Additional imagery will also be added based on finding suitable imagery or non-copyright issues that may also be deemed appropriate.

For any questions, contact Craig Reino.
Thank you.
